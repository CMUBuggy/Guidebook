\chapter{Assistant Chairman}
\label{ch:Ass Chair}
This chapter is chock-full of useful information about how to be a good
Assistant Chairman!

\section{Cookies}
\label{sec:Cookies}
The number one most important job of the Assistant Chairman is to bring cookies
to Rolls. At least once.

\section{Roll Count}
\label{sec:Roll Count}
This is actually important. Keep track of all buggy/driver combinations.
Give the Safety Chair a sheet each day to mark which ones passed drops.
Count how many rolls each buggy/driver got. A complete roll is making
it through the chute, even if they successfully stopped at a stop flag on the
way. Keep track of pass tests when that happens. Have fun with it! There is an
amazing spreadsheet in the 2015 section of Google Drive which will
automatically show you when drivers are qualified, which is not a trivial task.

\section{Assist}
\label{sec: Assist}
If the Chairman is absent, you become acting Chairman. Good luck!
