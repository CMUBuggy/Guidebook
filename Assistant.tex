\chapter{Assistant Chairman}
This chapter is chock-full of useful information about how to be a good
Assistant Chairman!

\section{Cookies}
It is of the utmost importance that the Assistant Chairman bring cookies
to Rolls. At least once.

\section{Roll Count}
This is actually important. Keep track of all buggy/driver combinations.
Give the Safety Chair a sheet each day to mark which ones passed drops.
Count how many rolls each buggy/driver got. A complete roll is making
it through the chute. Keep track of pass tests when that happens.
Have fun with it! There is an amazing spreadsheet in the 2015 section of
Google Drive which will show you when drivers are qualified, which is not
a trivial task.

\section{Assist}
If the Chairman is absent, you become acting Chairman. Good luck!
