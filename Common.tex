This chapter details common information that all members of the Sweepstakes
committee should be aware of.

Sweepstakes is constantly scrutinized by many watchful eyes. Because of this,
it is important for Sweepstakes to have a unified and consistent image that
it presents to the world.

\subsection{Logos}
\label{subsec:Logos}
There have been many Sweepstakes logos throughout the years, with each year's
committee creating their own unique image. It is the recommendation of this
guide that Sweepstakes adopt a single logo for general-purpose use. The one in
most prevalent use at the time of this writing is the Thorn logo, created by
Daniel Kane. Give credit when possible, and remember that the font used is
Futura.
\\
Additional yearly logos may be created, but should be used in limited
circumstances, such as in the Buggy Book or on yearly T-shirts or flyers.

\subsection{Website}
\label{subsec:Website}
At the time of this writing, cmubuggy.org is the de facto official website for
Buggy as a sport. This poses a number of potential problems.

\begin{itemize}
\item The important historical and logistical information stored there is
  not stored in any other location, thus if the website were to fail,
  the information would be lost.
\item The website is not maintained by any official member of Sweepstakes.
  Thus, the information could in inaccurate or incomplete.
\item There will not necessarily be consistent leadership in the BAA,
  which could cause fluctuations in the website's reliability.
\end{itemize}


For these reasons, it is important that each Sweepstakes committee makes
an effort to keep the official Sweepstakes website up-to-date and to point
spectators and participants to it whenever possible in favor of cmubuggy.org.
This website is:
\\
www.cmu.edu/buggy
\\
\\
The website can be easily edited on any Andrew cluster machine at the path
\url{~buggy/www/Sweepstakes/}
\\
The Welcome.html file contains all basic information and should be updated
every year at minimum to reflect changes in personnel, dates, etc.
\\
To publish updates to the web, go to https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/server/publish.html
and enter the user ID ``buggy'' in the Personal Web Pages section. Click Publish.
You should then see your changes reflected on the live website.

\subsection{Titles}
\label{subsec:Titles}
There are certain mistakes consistently made when addressing Sweepstakes
members, so for clarity here is an enumeration:

\begin{itemize}
\item Sweepstakes Chairman (not chairMEN. Chairmen is the plural of the word
and is used to refer to the collective group made up of each team's chairman).
\item Assistant Chairman (Ass Chair is acceptible, but not in official contexts).
\item Safety Chairman
\item Buggy Showcase Chair (this one is new, so just be consistent).
\item Buggy Book Chair (no hyphen, buggy and book are two words).
\item Sweepstakes Advisor (not adviser).
\item Raceday (not Race Day. Not RaceDay. Not Race-day).
\end{itemize}
