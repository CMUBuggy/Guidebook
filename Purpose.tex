\label{ch:Purpose}

The purpose of this Guidebook is to concisely pass important and useful
information from one generation of Sweepstakes to the next. This document is
separate from and non-overlapping with the Official Sweepstakes Rules, which
documents all necessary procedures. The information in this guidebook need
not necessarily be followed, but has been proven sound by previous Sweepstakes
committees and will likely help the current Sweepstakes committee in their job.
\\\\
This guidebook should be updated by each generation of Sweepstakes to reflect
changes in procedure or additional knowledge that is felt to be worth
passing on.
